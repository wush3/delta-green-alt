# Main feature differences are:
## Hover over modifiers
Skills, weapon attacks and damage fields have hover over modifier fields to enable fast rolling. The sheet itself is resizeable to make it possible to make room for the hover modifier.
## Different formatting and ordering of the skill list
The skill list is ordered alphabeticaly from top to bottom and everything is formatted to rquire minimal scrolling.
## Skill List is stored in Compendiums
To add skills to a character import the Skill Compendia. Then you can add all basic skills by drag and dropping the Basic Skills folder from the items tab on the characters skill list.
## Automation of skill increses checkmarks
Checkmarks for failed skill rolls are set automatically on a failed test. When the small upward arrow button on the left side of the skill list is pressed all chekced skills are improved by 1d4 automatically.
## Competency Highlighting for skills
the small toggle button on the left side of the skill list color codes skills by competency.
## Bonds, Motivations and Disroders
These need to be created as an item and dragged to the according box. Motivations and disorders have a toggle swithc to turn motivations into disorders.
## Indented Container based gear sorting and equip status
If an Item's name is written into another items location field that items becomes a container. All items in that container are sorted under it and indented to show item relationships. Weapons and Armor can be marked as equipped this makes them appear in the attacks and armor lists. Total armor value is shown on the first page.


# Unfinished planned stuff
* An unnatural page for tomes and rituals.
* An npc/creature sheet that resembles stat blocks from the handlers guide
* A vehicle item type
* Fields for the certain hidden stats
* Getting rid of the last few V10 compatibility warnings
